        <h2>CSS (cascading Style Sheet) Indroduction</h2>
        <p><b></b>Cascading Style Sheets</b>, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simply designed language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independently of the HTML that makes up each web page. It describes how a webpage should look: it prescribes colours, fonts, spacing, and much more. In short, you can make your website look however you want. CSS lets developers and designers define how it behaves, including how elements are positioned in the browser.
           While HTML uses tags, CSS uses rulesets. CSS is easy to learn and understand, but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.</p>

           <h2>Why CSS?</h2>
           <ul>
            <li><b>CSS saves time :</b> You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet in multiple HTML pages.</li><br>
            <li><b>Easy Maintenance :</b> To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.</li><br>
            <li><b>Search Engines :</b> CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.</li><br>
            <li><b>Superior styles to HTML :</b> CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.</li><br>
            <li><b>Offline Browsing :</b> CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using this we can view offline websites.
            </li><br>
           </ul>

           <h2>CSS First Steps</h2>
           <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</p><br>
           <h2>CSS building blocks</h2>
           <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more. <br>
            The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.</p>

           <h2>CSS styling text</h2>
           <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.</p>

           <h2>CSS layout</h2>
           <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.</p>

          <h2>Advantages of CSS:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS plays an important role, by using CSS you simply got to specify a repeated style for element once & use it multiple times as because CSS will automatically apply the required styles.</li><br>
            <li>The main advantage of CSS is that style is applied consistently across variety of sites. One instruction can control several areas which is advantageous.</li><br>
            <li>Web designers needs to use few lines of programming for every page improving site speed.</li><br>
            <li>Cascading sheet not only simplifies website development, but also simplifies the maintenance as a change of one line of code affects the whole web site and maintenance time.</li><br>
          </ul>
          <h2>Disadvantages of CSS:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>CSS, CSS 1 up to CSS3, result in creating of confusion among  web browsers.</li><br>
            <li>With CSS, what works with one browser might not always work with another. The web developers need to test for compatibility, running the program across multiple browsers.</li><br>
            <li>There exists a scarcity of security.</li><br>
            <li>After making the changes we need to confirm the compatibility if they appear. The similar change affects on all the browsers.</li><br>
